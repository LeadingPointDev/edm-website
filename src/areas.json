A Party is defined as any Person or Organization who interacts with LPL in one or more roles and who has a Name and at least one method of contact information (such as Address, Phone, and/or Email). Party Roles for a Person include, but are not limited to, Advisor, Licensed Assistant, Non-Licensed Assistant, Investor, and Employee, etc. Party Roles for an Organization include, but are not limited to, Institution, RIA Firm, etc. A Party may play multiple roles as a Person or Organization, but a Party cannot be both a Person and an Organization. This subject area represents a single source of truth for a Party even in cases where multiple roles exist for the same Party, and/or when data is available from multiple sources and needs to be mastered.",
