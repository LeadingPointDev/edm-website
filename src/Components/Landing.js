            <h2>Data Foundation: data as a strategic asset</h2>
            <p>The objective is to delivering all data needs through a dedicated data
                organisation and platform as a firmwide strategic enabler.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This will involve transition from the legacy complex fragmented infrastructure to a strategic,
                    event-driven architecture based on AWS Cloud and Snowflake platform.</li>
                <li>The roadmap includes a complete redesign of data processing at LPL, with a new Enterprise Data Model
                    (EDM), API-Driven data abstraction layer for consumers and transition from batch to event-driven and
                    streaming data flows, supported with clearly defined reference data masters.</li>
                <li>Governance will be improved along with updates to data policy, procedures and the controls framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Business Value</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Alignment of the data strategy and delivered platforms to the firms' vision, goals and objectives;
                    including key integration activities such as project Granite.</li>
                <li>Support business strategy and growth plans through the provision of complete, accurate and timely
                    data with improved data take-on, automation and processes to enable a more agile approach and reduced
                    time-to-market for new entities, clients and products.</li>
                <li>Provision of a robust framework for the control, security and management of data assets with clear standards,
                    policy and processes to ensure compliance with internal and applicable regulatory objectives.</li>
                <li>Establishing a consistent understanding of data assets, flows and rules to enable cross functional collaboration,
                    ongoing entity, client and product delivery, and new project development through the provision of common models,
                    dictionaries and taxonomies covering the entire data lineage.</li>
                <li>A consolidated technical data architecture with a single point of entry, trusted master repository/system of
                    record and standardized distribution service along with a high degree of automation yielding improved data
                    quality, efficiency and freeing resource for value-adding activities.</li>
                <li>Reliable, trusted and defendable data as the result of an integrated, measurable and robust source-to-consumer
                    data quality framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Foundation Tenants</h3>
            <p>The strategy and delivery roadmap is based on four fundamental tenants of enterprise data:</p>
            <p>Control: Democratised and embedded up front data governance, with platform enforced controls, protection and provisioning</p>
            <p>Available: A comprehensive single point of meaningful verified data on a self-service basis, with supporting catalogue,
                lineage and business definition</p>
            <p>Trusted: Data quality at the centre of the strategy, with automated monitoring, approved remediation and reporting across
                the pipeline</p>
            <p>Valuable: Business lead customer centric data services and management, enabling efficient production of data into customer
                solutions</p>
